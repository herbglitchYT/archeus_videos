# Description
This project is meant as a tool to help learn how to make a vector in c (or just the general concept of how a vector works).

# Style
The style guide is my person style for writing code, I will be writing all projects with that code where possible. I still need to figure out how to handle macros and c++ though.

# Controller Scripts
I wanted to try animating stuff, but kinda suck at art. So I decided to use ydotool and venn (a neovim plugin) to create and animate a diagram. This also helps with recording the code typing part, cuz I make mistakes all the time, but a program wont. The code for controller is open source, though I need to move it to gitlab (codeberg doesn't work in some regions). I'll try to remember to update this when I do :)

I wrote all the controller code in one to two days, so currently the scripts used are very rough. I plan to turn the scripting language into an actual language, so animating will be much easier.

# Archeus
In the video you will notice I use ARC_ for everything, this is because this code is meant to be part of my game engine Archeus. The full Archeus code is on gitlab currently, but it is still really early in its alpha stage. Also, these videos will cover all of the code within Archeus.
